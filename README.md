# Patent Intelligence Dashboard

**Showcase of Topic Modelling Patents for Competitive Intelligence**

This is a Dash application for visualizing the results of technology mining applied to a patent dataset.

## Status

- Competitive Intelligence Dashboard is under active development.
- Source code for data cleaning and modelling is complete (to be released).
- Python package for a custom physics-based bubble layout is complete (to be released).

This repository will eventually become part of a larger modular pipeline for strategic intelligence, pending academic publication and industrial sponsor approval.
